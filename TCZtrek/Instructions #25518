%g%L - %y%Lshort %w%Lrange scan shows you the current galaxy

If your team controls more of a sector than the other team, your team then controls that galaxy. %w%LA team wins when every galaxy in the %y%Llong%w%L range scan is coloured red or blue. %w%LIf a team cannot capture all galaxies, the team with the most galaxies under their control after a pre-determined time wins.
