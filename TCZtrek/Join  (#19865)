REM: Joining the Fleet in TCZ Trek. 
REM - One Argument, name of ship, hopefully allows spaces :I

@if {@eval {@?noitems "," "$3"} == 2} do
     @temp grow = {@?itemno 1 ";" "$3"}
     @temp gcol = {@?itemno 2 ";" "$3"}
     @temp srow = {@?itemno 3 ";" "$3"}
     @temp scol = {@?itemno 4 ";" "$3"}
     @temp val  = {@?itemno 5 ";" "$3"}
  
  REM make sure we have good ranges on these coordinates (15x15 and 9x9, respectively)
