 PAGING from Space, The Final Frontier(#22018 RAHOQywFVT):  Starace says "Yeah definitely need a
  team chat.  I think a player list that shows teams and who's actually actively in the room.  You
  might also want to notify players that their AP have been replenished as well, or at least have
  an option to see it or turn it off." (trekwho)
  
 9. Add "Repair" that costs AP similar to reload. DONE
 10. Add rank calculations for players.
 11. Darker if not over >50% conquered.
