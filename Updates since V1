V1.1

1. Created Repair for fixing armor and shields at respective starbases (repair costs 1AP)
2. See the current players and teams (Trekwho)
3. Specialized nat for your respective teams (treknat)
4. Fixed bug that prevented players from going right past the middle of the universe.
5. Added nat status to Playerarray so you can turn it on and off.
6. Added notifications for online players to know who is damaging their ship and if/when they are destroyed. Working on notifications for out of Space or offline players.


V1.2

2. Added an "In space?" column to TREKwho
3. Removed TCZ prefixes/suffixes from scans and hails.

V1.3

%g%LMore TCZTrek Updates! 
%y%L1. %w%LAdded a galaxycount to the Long Range Scan so you can tell how many galaxies have been conquered or remain unconquered.
%y%L2. %w%LDynamic AP resets. If you have less players on your team, each player on your team will get an AP boost!
%y%L3. %w%LPrevented players from shooting themselves (The Lorax Manoeuvre)
%y%L4. %w%LWorking shields! Taking damage will first affect your shields before affecting your ship health.
%y%L5. %w%LRegenerating shields! Shields will regenerate 10 points every hour. (Armor doesn't.)
%y%L6. %w%LTo make up for working shields, damage from phasers and torpedos have been increased substantially(x2). (phasers do between 2-20 damage, torpedos 4-40)

V1.4
%g%LSome TCZTrek Updates! 
%y%L1. %w%LAutomatic game end and reset. On any team getting control of all 225 galaxies at a reset time, the game will end and the winning team will be posted to the BBS. After that, the galaxy will be blanked and all players removed to begin again.
%y%L2. %w%LIncreased weapon loadouts to 20 for both torpedos and phasers from the current 10. This should make combat more engaging and require less returns home.
%y%L3. %w%LTreknat now makes use of your Trek prefix and not your spammy TCZ prefixes.
%y%l4. %w%LHailing an enemy returns incomplete information. Hailing a friend returns everything


V1.5
%g%LFurther TCZTrek Updates! 
%y%L1. %w%LNew command %y%LTrekstat%w%L for all the details on player conduct within the game.
%y%L2. %w%Lnew command %y%Ltrekkill%w%L for a list of murders and victims in the game by date.


V1.6
%g%LFixes!
%y%L1. %w%LFixed Lorax Manoeuvre with torpedos.
%y%L2. %w%LFixed instances where sector captures along the last column don't get counted towards a galaxy capture.
%y%L3. %W%LFixed game end mechanics where a BBS post wasn't being made and the game wouldn't end.
%y%L4. %w%LFixed game reset to add back colouring system placeholders.
%y%L5. %w%lActually added comma check that I had lied about previously so you boobs wouldn't break the game continually.

Enhancements!
%y%L1. Added the season number to trekkill.
%y%L2. Improved "join" command lets you know which team you're on first BEFORE you enter a name. Just type "join" at TCZtrek and follow the prompts.
%y%L3. New galaxy map colour coding: darker colours indicate a weaker conquer while brighter colours indicate stronger sector controls. (Controlling a galaxy by 5 or more sectors over the opponents makes it bright)
