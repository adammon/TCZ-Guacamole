TCZTrek Code Priorities
1. Fix buggy Impulse. (Not entering a correct direction screws up AP and doesn't fill out short correctly. - FIXED
2. Update Warp to use new TeamLookup.
3. Update Long to colour correctly using a GalaxyStatus?
4. Clean up Short's code to be less copied and pasted status text.
5. Ensure collision code is working properly.
6. Build out phaser code (maybe code Collision as its own command?)
7. Build out torpedo code (collision command?)
8. Figure out Hail so it's better (Works now but takes up a lot of space. SHould it use an AP?)
9. Figure out reload. (Have to be proximal to starbase. Available at 1,1,1,1 and 15,15,9,9
10. Character origination
