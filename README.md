TCZTrek Code Priorities
1. Fix buggy Impulse. (Not entering a correct direction screws up AP and doesn't fill out short correctly. - FIXED
2. Update Warp to use new TeamLookup. FIXED
3. Update Long to colour correctly using a GalaxyStatus? - FIXED
4. Clean up Short's code to be less copied and pasted status text. FIXED
5. Ensure collision code is working properly. FIXED AND WORKING for Impulse (Need to test warp still)
6. Build out phaser code - WORKING - Proximity working.
7. Build out torpedo code - WORKING - Uses 1AP and can fire from anywhere, but misses 50% of the time. hahaha)
8. Figure out Hail so it's better (Works now but takes up a lot of space. SHould it use an AP?)
9. Figure out reload. (Have to be proximal to starbase. Available at 1,1,1,1 and 15,15,9,9
10. Character origination
